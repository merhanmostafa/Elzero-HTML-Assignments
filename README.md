#HTML
It stands for **Hyper Text Markup Language**

####Notes:
* What we type in the '<head>' tag doesn't appear on the browser page.
* The '<title>' tag defines the title of the document 
* The '<meta>' tag is a self closing tag.
* There are three modes used by the layout engines in web browsers :
    1-quirks mode
    2-Standard mode
    3-Full standard mode
* Browsers use a **DOCTYPE** in the beginning of the document to decide whether to handle it in quirks mode or standards mode,to ensure that your page uses full standards mode
